    <h2>Software Development: </h2>
    <p>Software development refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software.”

        Software itself is the set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do. It is independent of hardware and makes computers programmable. There are three basic types:
        
        System software to provide core functions such as operating systems, disk management, utilities, hardware management and other operational necessities.
        
        Programming software to give programmers tools such as text editors, compilers, linkers, debuggers and other tools to create code.
        
        Application software (applications or apps) to help users perform tasks. Office productivity suites, data management software, media players and security programs are examples. Applications also refers to web and mobile applications like those used to shop on Amazon.com, socialize with Facebook or post pictures to Instagram.1
        
        A possible fourth type is embedded software. Embedded systems software is used to control machines and devices not typically considered computers — telecommunications networks, cars, industrial robots and more. These devices, and their software, can be connected as part of the Internet of Things (IoT).2
        
        Software development is primarily conducted by programmers, software engineers and software developers. These roles interact and overlap, and the dynamics between them vary greatly across development departments and communities.
        
        Programmers, or coders, write source code to program computers for specific tasks like merging databases, processing online orders, routing communications, conducting searches or displaying text and graphics. Programmers typically interpret instructions from software developers and engineers and use programming languages like C++ or Java to carry them out.
        
        Software engineers apply engineering principles to build software and systems to solve problems. They use modeling language and other tools to devise solutions that can often be applied to problems in a general way, as opposed to merely solving for a specific instance or client. Software engineering solutions adhere to the scientific method and must work in the real world, as with bridges or elevators. Their responsibility has grown as products have become increasingly more intelligent with the addition of microprocessors, sensors and software. Not only are more products relying on software for market differentiation, but their software development must be coordinated with the product’s mechanical and electrical development work.
        
        Software developers have a less formal role than engineers and can be closely involved with specific project areas — including writing code. At the same time, they drive the overall software development lifecycle — including working across functional teams to transform requirements into features, managing development teams and processes, and conducting software testing and maintenance.3
        
        The work of software development isn’t confined to coders or development teams. Professionals such as scientists, device fabricators and hardware makers also create software code even though they are not primarily software developers. Nor is it confined to traditional information technology industries such as software or semiconductor businesses. In fact, according to the Brookings Institute (link resides outside of ibm.com), those businesses “account for less than half of the companies performing software development.”
        
        An important distinction is custom software development as opposed to commercial software development. Custom software development is the process of designing, creating, deploying and maintaining software for a specific set of users, functions or organizations. In contrast, commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) is designed for a broad set of requirements, allowing it to be packaged and commercially marketed and distributed.

    <h2> Software engineering: </h2>
    <p>
        A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate computer software. The term programmer is sometimes used as a synonym, but may also lack connotations of engineering education or skills.

Engineering techniques are used to inform the software development process[1][4] which involves the definition, implementation, assessment, measurement, management, change, and improvement of the software life cycle process itself. It heavily uses software configuration management[1][4] which is about systematically controlling changes to the configuration, and maintaining the integrity and traceability of the configuration and code throughout the system life cycle. Modern processes use software versioning.

    <h2> key principles of good software design?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Completeness</h3>
            Good software design encompasses the necessary software components of modules, data objects, external interfaces, and more. All dependencies between modules and other virtual entities should be harmonized and comply with inheritance principles.
        </li>
        <li><h3>Modularity and Scalability</h3>
            Good software design should be easily scalable and easy to understand long after it has been delivered. It needs to be built according to the famous modularity principle widely used in all fields of engineering, with all modules arranged in layers. 
        </li>
        <li><h3>Optimal Resource Consumption </h3>
            Good software design includes a wise, cost-efficient approach to system resources. Efficiency is one of the critical factors identifying high-quality software design.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Correctness</h3>
            Good software design means building a healthy system characterized by a correct, conflict-free integration of all essential software elements and functionalities. </li>
        <li><h3>Maintainability </h3>
            Great software design offers flexibility and readiness for implementation of change requests (for example, adding new features). At TATEEDA, we provide maintainable software development services for several large companies in the U.S. We understand that maintainable software design is a true fundamental for competitiveness and continuous improvements.   </li>
      </ul>

    <h2>What is a bug?</h2>
    <p>A software bug is a problem causing a program to crash or produce invalid output. The problem is caused by insufficient or erroneous logic. A bug can be an error, mistake, defect or fault, which may cause failure or deviation from expected results.

        Most bugs are due to human errors in source code or its design. A program is said to be buggy when it contains a large number of bugs, which affect program functionality and cause incorrect results.</p>
